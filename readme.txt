The RAMCO-API-AdminTools were built by Matthew Brewer (@mbrewer22) with some assistance from @conroydave.

Getting started:
Install and configure (L)(W)(M)AMP.
Add your API key to the config.php file
The style.css file is a nice mess cause, well, I quickly learned some css stuff and just made it work. If you clean it up please share! 

Read the API doco for help on building a query. The API query tool is pretty nice but you have to know what you are doing.
Example of query:

Operation: GetEntities
Entity: contact
Filter: LastName<sc>#Brewer# and Firstname<sc>#M#
Attributes: LastName,FirstName,cobalt_nrdsid,emailaddress1

Another filter example:
Filter: incidentid<sc>73a98cd0-f0ed-e411-a0aa-00155d631504
